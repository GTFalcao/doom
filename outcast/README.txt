*****************************

is a Doom/Zandronum mod created by Guilherme Falc√£o, also known as SwordGrunt
in the Doom community.

Anything that is not credited here has been made by me, including the entirety
of the ACS and Decorate in this mod.

You may reuse any content from this mod in your own projects, as long as credit
is given for whatever you use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outcast is made as a flexible gameplay-altering mod, fully compatible with
any vanilla-style wads of Doom, Heretic and Hexen as well as many other
gameplay-altering mods, though full compatibility with these is not guaranteed.

The game is balanced around a cooperative environment - Survival is its original
intended gamemode, but regular Cooperative and Invasion also go incredibly well
with it. Competitive gamemodes, such as Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Last Man
Standing or Possession are supported and fully playable, but for the time being
the same mod cannot be balanced for both coop and compet types of play.

There are many CVars that allow customizing gameplay, such as keeping your ranks
between levels in the same hub or even for the entire game. Players can also be
set to start on a specific rank to adjust the difficulty - for instance, you can
decide to start on rank 6, spawning as a Revenant, Undead Knight, Dark Bishop or
Loremaster/Templar/Bishop.

There is much more to this game than I can type out in this text file.
Many things have been kept as close to the original as possible - some that only
the most careful eyes will notice. I hope you have as much fun discovering every
little aspect of this game and the limitless possibilities to play it as I had
making it for you.
