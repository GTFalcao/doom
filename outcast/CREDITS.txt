CREDITS:

id, Raven and Rogue for creating the fantastic games we have on this engine.
Almost all graphics used on this mod were based on resources from the IWADs for
Doom, Heretic, Hexen and Strife, as well as Doom 64 by Midway Games.

Phobus, for creating Virus, the Doom mod that is practically a new game itself.
Although he never released the finished mod, the monsters were seen on the ZDoom
Wars faction and are now playable as the Virus class on Outcast.


Jonathan - a fuckton of testing and feedback

Icon of sin 666 - extensive testing and feedback, also this guy is not human

Turret_Master - also helped with testing and feedback a bunch


Repo Man - testing, suggestions, and overall heavily contributing for this mod
to be what it is today. I used the healthbar graphics (edited the edge slightly)
he made for ZDoom Wars, too.


Ransu - provided the remastered ORB (Hexen loading song) used in this mod, and
many of his other tracks were a wonder to listen to while working countless
hours on this. Thank you for the fantastic work and keep it up!
